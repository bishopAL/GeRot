# Gerot

GeRot is a gecko-inspired wall-climbing robot with Dynamixel motors. This Document will guide you to use this API correctly.

We provide C++ and Python API to the robot, you can check them in [Here](https://github.com/bishopAL/GeRot/tree/master/API). We take the Python version as an example.

## 1. Environmental Configuration


Before you using this API, make sure you have installed **Python2** or **Python3** correctly.
Then we have to deal with USB lantency timer. USB device always has a **lantency** before it sends the data, it will make your control task vert slow, so you probably need to reduce the lantency. 
In Fact, RS-485 with its USB device is not a good way to control a robot, EtherCat or CAN will be better.

+ In Ubuntu, you should run the codes below in terminnal to reduce the USB latency:
   > sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER && echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer

  On the other way, you may change it permenantly by doing this:
    >sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/latency-usb.rules
    
    Add these codes:
    >ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb-serial", DRIVER=="ftdi_sio", ATTR{latency_timer}="1" 

    Save. Finally:

    >sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

    >sudo udevadm trigger --action=add

    You may check the result like:
    
    >cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer

+ In windows, check [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Lampduino-an-8x8-RGB-Floor-Lamp/), you can find it in step 20.

## 2. Python Package Install


1. Go to https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK, clone this repo.
2. Open the repo in your terminal, then
    >cd python

    run 
    >python setup.py install

    NOTICE: If you have installed anaconda in Ubuntu and you want to use the API with it. You have to specify the "python" above, because if you use "sudo", you will use the originnal python in your system. Maybe you can do it like
    > ~/Anaconda3/bin/python3 setup.py install
    
3. Go to this repo, 
    >cd dynamixel-egg
   
    then, 
    >python setup.py install

    now you have installed the driver package, you may connect your motor to your pc.

4. Check AMC_oneleg_newapi.py, you can specify the parameters in 
    >motor0 = DxlAPI(range(3), '/dev/ttyUSB0')

    The first parameter is to set the motor's ID, it should like [0,1,2]. The second one is to set the port(in Ubuntu is like '/dev/ttyUSB0', in Windows is like 'COM1'), the third one is to set baurdrate. Make sure you have make these parameters right.

## 3. How to Use


In the example, we test 3 motors in position control mode.

Here are the things need to be done:


1. import the package we need, like
```python
from dynamixel.mt_dxl import DxlAPI
```

2. init, like
```python
motor_group = DxlAPI(range(3), '/dev/ttyUSB0')
```

3. set the operating mode, like
```python
motor_group.set_operating_mode('p')
```
if you want to use torque control mode, input 't' instead of 'p'.

4. turn on the motor, like
```python
motor_group.torque_enable()
```

5. drive the motor with your code, like
```python
motor_group.set_position([0, 0, 0])
```
each element in [0, 0, 0] is a angle in (-pi, pi).

If you want to set the torque, use *motor_group.set_torque()* instead, this function has to be used in torque control mode.

If everything is good, the motor moves.

6. shutdown the motor, like
```python
motor_group.torque_disable()
motor_group.portHandler.closePort()
```
